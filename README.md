# CPLN680-AdvancedGIS (In Progress)
*by Huiling He at University of Pennsylvania*

This is the capstone project I have been doing for the course CPLN680-Advanced Topic in GIS, taught by Dana Tomlin at University of Pennsylvania, City Planning Department. 

This project is focusing on housing price prediction in Beijing, using the open-source dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ruiqurm/lianjia).
